This repository contains our Python project for the course 
"Python for data analysis". The owners of the project are 
CÃ©lina Ben Mansour and Thomas Ariza.

It consists of the creation of a Machine Learning model 
to predict the target variable of a given dataset. The dataset we 
studied iscalled "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic".
It is a dataset for the estimation of obesity levels based on eating 
habits and physical condition in individuals 

from Colombia, Peru and Mexico. The target variable of the dataset 
is The Obesity level (NObeyesdad), whic is a class variable. 
In this study, we face a problem of supervised learning classification.
We conclude our work by using a random forest classifier model 
for our predictions. 

Moreover, we go further in our study by trying to find a regression model 
to predict the answers for the weight variable.
This seconnd study ends up by finding that our best model is 
the Random Forest Regressor model.
